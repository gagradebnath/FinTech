## 🔄 APPLICATION RESTART NEEDED

The deployment-info.json has been updated with all 555 users and their real balances, but the Flask application needs to be restarted to load the new accounts.

### What happened:
- ✅ deployment-info.json updated with 555 users and real balances
- ❌ Flask application still using old accounts (only 5 users)
- ❌ Solidity blockchain still returns "User address not found"

### Solution:
**RESTART THE FLASK APPLICATION** to load the updated deployment-info.json

### Steps:
1. Stop the current Flask server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run `python run.py` again
3. Try the transaction - it should work without "User address not found" errors

### Expected Results After Restart:
- ✅ All 555 users will be recognized by Solidity blockchain
- ✅ "user" and "user15" will have their real balances
- ✅ No more "User address not found" errors
- ✅ Transactions should process successfully on both blockchains

The MySQL transaction already worked - we just need the Solidity blockchain to recognize the users!
