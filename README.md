## Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Initialize the database:**
   ```cmd
   python seed_sqlite.py
   ```
3. **Run the app:**
   ```cmd
   python run.py
   ```
4. **Access the app:**
   Open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Demo Accounts (For Quick Testing)

After running the seed script, you can log in with the following demo users:

| Role   | User ID | Password |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Admin  | admin   | admin    |
| Agent  | agent   | agent    |
| User   | user    | user     |

All demo accounts start with a balance of 10,000. You can use these credentials to test all admin, agent, and user flows immediately after setup.

## Database
- SQLite database (`fin_guard.db`)
- Schema defined in `DatabaseSchema.sql`
- Seed script: `seed_sqlite.py`

## Key Features and Functionality

- Transaction monitoring

### UI Features
- Modern dark theme with animated gradient backgrounds
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Consistent styling across all pages

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

### Flask Version Compatibility
- If you encounter a `JSONEncoder` import error, update `app/__init__.py` to use `json.JSONEncoder` instead of `flask.json.JSONEncoder`
- Alternatively, specify Flask version 2.2.x or earlier in requirements.txt

### Database Reset
- If you change the database schema, you'll need to re-run `seed_sqlite.py` to reset the database
- This will erase all existing data and create fresh tables with demo accounts

## How to Change and Debug

### Making Changes
- **Edit Python code:**
  - All backend logic is in the `app/routes/` directory. For example, to change budget logic, edit `budget.py`.
  - Templates (HTML) are in `app/templates/`. For UI changes, edit the relevant HTML file.
  - Static files (JS, CSS) are in `app/static/`.
- **Database schema:**
  - To change the database structure, edit `DatabaseSchema.sql` and re-run `seed_sqlite.py` (note: this will reset your data).
- **Add new features:**
  - Create a new route file in `app/routes/` and register its blueprint in `app/routes/__init__.py`.
  - Add new templates or static files as needed.

### Debugging
- **Enable debug mode:**
  - The app runs in debug mode by default (`app.run(debug=True)` in `run.py`). This provides detailed error messages in the browser.
- **View logs:**
  - Print statements in Python will appear in your terminal.
  - JS logs can be sent to the server using the `/log` endpoint, or viewed in the browser console (F12).
- **Common issues:**
  - If you see a `BuildError` for a route, check that you are using the correct blueprint name in `url_for` (e.g., `budget.plan_budget` not `user.plan_budget`).
  - If the database schema changes, re-run `seed_sqlite.py` to reset tables.
- **Hot reload:**
  - Flask will auto-reload on code changes when in debug mode. If not, restart the server manually.
- **Windows users:**
  - Use `python run.py` in `cmd.exe` to start the server.
