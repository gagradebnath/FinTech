# Transaction Type ENUM Fix Summary

## Issue
The MySQL `transactions` table has a `type` column defined as:
```sql
`type` ENUM('Transfer', 'Deposit', 'Withdrawal', 'Payment', 'Refund')
```

But the application code was trying to insert invalid values that weren't in the ENUM list.

## Fixed Files and Changes

### 1. app/utils/transaction_utils.py
- **Fixed**: `agent_add_money()` - Changed `'add_money'` → `'Deposit'`
- **Fixed**: `agent_cash_out()` - Changed `'cash_out'` → `'Withdrawal'`

### 2. app/routes/transaction.py  
- **Fixed**: `send_money()` call - Changed `'transfer'` → `'Transfer'`

### 3. app/routes/admin.py
- **Fixed**: `insert_transaction_admin()` call - Changed `'admin_add_money'` → `'Deposit'`

## Valid Transaction Types (MySQL ENUM)
- `'Transfer'` - For money transfers between users
- `'Deposit'` - For adding money (agent add money, admin add money)
- `'Withdrawal'` - For taking money out (agent cash out)
- `'Payment'` - For payments
- `'Refund'` - For refunds

## Test Results Expected
- ✅ Agent add money should now work without ENUM errors
- ✅ Agent cash out should now work without ENUM errors  
- ✅ Regular user transfers should work without ENUM errors
- ✅ Admin add money to agent should work without ENUM errors

## Files That Were Already Correct
- `seed_mysql.py` - Already using correct ENUM values
- Database schema - ENUM definition is correct

The agent add money functionality should now work properly without the "Data truncated for column 'type'" error.
