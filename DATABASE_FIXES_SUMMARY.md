# Database Connection Fixes Applied

## Problem
The application was throwing `pymysql.err.Error: Already closed` errors when trying to access the admin dashboard and other database functions.

## Root Cause
Several functions in the utility modules had nested try-except blocks that were both trying to close the same database connection, causing a "double close" error.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `app/utils/admin_utils.py`
- **Function**: `get_agents()` (lines 43-70)
- **Function**: `get_all_users()` (lines 17-41)
- **Issue**: Nested try-except blocks with multiple `conn.close()` calls
- **Fix**: Removed nested connection creation in exception handler, using single connection throughout

### 2. `app/utils/dashboard.py`
- **Function**: `get_user_budgets()` (lines 52-71)
- **Issue**: Same nested try-except pattern with double `conn.close()`
- **Fix**: Removed nested connection creation in exception handler

### 3. `app/utils/transaction_utils.py`
- **Functions**: `lookup_user_by_identifier()` and `is_user_flagged_fraud()` 
- **Issue**: Missing functions that were being imported
- **Fix**: Added both functions with proper database connection handling

### 4. `app/utils/auth.py`
- **Function**: `login_required()` decorator
- **Issue**: Missing function that was being imported
- **Fix**: Added the decorator function

## Pattern Fixed
The problematic pattern was:
```python
def function():
    conn = get_db_connection()
    try:
        # database operations
    except Exception as e:
        # Create NEW connection here (problematic)
        conn = get_db_connection()
        try:
            # fallback operations
        finally:
            conn.close()  # Close new connection
    finally:
        conn.close()  # Close original connection (causes error)
```

Fixed to:
```python
def function():
    conn = get_db_connection()
    try:
        # database operations
    except Exception as e:
        # Use SAME connection for fallback
        try:
            # fallback operations using same conn
        except Exception as fallback_error:
            # Handle fallback errors
            return []
    finally:
        conn.close()  # Close connection only once
```

## Testing
- All import errors resolved
- Database connection issues fixed
- Application starts without errors
- Admin dashboard should now work correctly

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The application should now run without database connection errors.

Run `python run.py` to start the application.
